        <h1>Why This?</h1>
        <p>'Where's Biryani?' is our brainchild for presenting object recognition in a simple and entertaining manner. 
            We chose this topic not only because we found it interesting, but also because object recognition is being 
            used on a regular basis in various industries like retail, security, healthcare, and more. <br>
            To know more about the technicalities of our project, read on!

        <h1>Computer Vision</h1>
        <p>
            Computer vision is a field of AI that works with deriving meaningful information from digital images, 
            videos and other visual media. Computer vision enables computers to see and comprehend visual inputs.<br>
            It is being used in industries ranging from energy and utilities to manufacturing. Automotive giants like 
            Volvo, Audi, and BMW make use of computer vision in self-driving cars. It is projected to reach $41.11 
            billion by 2030.

        <h1>Object Recognition</h1>
        <p>
            Object recognition is a type of technology that is a part of computer vision. It is capable of locating 
            objects in images and other visual inputs.<br>
            Real-life applications include face and vehicle recognition, pedestrian counting, self-driving vehicles, 
            security systems, and more.
        </p>
        <h1>OpenCV</h1>
        <p>
            OpenCV is a widely used library for real-time computer vision and image processing.
            It is often used in factory product inspection, medical imaging, and security analysis.
        </p>
        <h1>Our Project</h1>
        <p>
            We make use of template matching, a method in digital image processing available in opencv for searching and 
            locating a template image in a source image.
            [insert diagram] <br>
            To recognise the template image, we have to compare it against the source image by sliding it, which means 
            moving the patch one pixel at a time. [insert diagram] <br>
            At every location, a metric will be calculated to represent how similar the patch is to our template image. 
            The metric is stored in a result matrix (a two-dimensional array, with values for x and y coordinates). 
            The function minMaxLoc is used to locate the highest value (or lowest, depending on the type of matching 
            method) in the result matrix.
